- **AI Agent with Tools:** Utilizes AI Agents with web search capabilities (Jina Search) to gather real-time, dynamic information.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Employs a sophisticated workflow with advanced prompt engineering for high-quality, reliable outputs.
- **Structured Output:** Converts unstructured LLM responses into structured JSON data for clean, professional report generation.
- **End-to-End Automation:** From data upload to final report generation, the entire process is automated.
